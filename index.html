  <h1>The Hardest Thing I've Learned</h1>
    <p>The use of the D3 algorithm as a means to create HTML visual elements that in some way correspond to to data elements was difficult
    for me to grasp at first. A good way to describe this use of D3 is in the sacred Murray Text where the prophet relates the function to
    a relay race with each individual "piece" being akin to each of the individual relayers. The function is started by invoking the power 
    of the D3 algorithm to select a location within an already existing HTML element. It then hands of a reference to the select all 
    command which selects all of a given element within the DOM; if none of the given elements exist yet, it returns an "empty" selector as
    a placeholder that reperesents the elements to be. The data command counts and parses out the data set given to it so that the data can
    be related to a visual element. Then the enter command has its services requested so that it can create new, data bound elements; if
    DOM elements aren't with us yet, it creates placeholder elements within the DOM. The append command is utilized next to take the empty
    placeholder elements and convert them into soon to be visible HTML elements. From here there are two paths known to me that the
    next relayer can take. Text can be inserted within the elements with the text command, or the attribute command can be used to insert
    images or other things within the element. See the JavaScript below for an example.</p>
    <pre>
      var drawpenguin = function (penData)
        {
          d3.select("#penguinPen")
            .selectAll("img")
            .data(penData)
            .enter()
            .append("img")
            .attr("src",function(d)
              {
                return d.picture;
              })
         }
    </pre>
  <h2>Questioning the Future</h2>
    <p>Due to my understanding of the material thus far or possibly my ignorance of what I'm ignornt of, I am told by the master to ask 
    where this knowledge is leading to. I'm curious as to how scraping works and the many possible things that can be done with it. The
     master has deemed us neophytes not yet worthy of it's powers and I'm even more curious about how to use it. I also suspect that the
     class will reveal more about D3 and the generation of web pages based on data.</p>
